                  For someone who has lost a spouse, a loving friend or partner, a parent, a child, a sibling, or other close relative, the gradual substitution of happiness for sadness is most challenging. Nevertheless, it is essential for one’s well-being and interactions with others.<br><br>
                  Sharing Joy Again! will be an interactive, holistic educational experience. It will engage your mind as we explore and present guidelines for confronting this challenge.  It is designed for like-minded people who are forward thinking,  love nature, and are curious about the origin of its beauty, as well as how being surrounded by this beauty can ease and inspire learning.<br><br>
                  Teaching will primarily focus on how to create and maintain joy, love, and serenity through the power of our minds, or MINDPOWER.  However, participants also will  leave the course with an in-depth knowledge of how the story of the alpine setting’s evolution through deep time can be read in the marvelous history “books” that have been left for us—rocks and landscape.

                  Virtually the entire learning experience will take place on a series of hikes over gently hilly terrain. Stops will punctuate the hikes for interactive lessons on nature and living contently. Instruction will be as in a traditionally taught class; it will not be based on interactive group therapy.
                <br><br>Many experts in life coaching recognize the value of relaxing their clients’ minds simply by talking about something else. This makes them more receptive to new ideas and insights. Discussion of a mix of life-lessons and geology throughout the hikes will form the foundation of the learning experience.
                <br><br>Optional evening, personalized one-on-one coaching lessons will supplement the daytime learning in the field. </p>

                    The beautiful 60 acre campus of the Indiana University Judson Mead Geologic Field Station will be the base for the entire three-day retreat. It is scenically located along the South Boulder River on the north side of the Tobacco Root Mountain Range in southwest Montana. The campus is about an hour’s drive from the Bozeman-Yellowstone International Airport.
                    <br><br>Many consider this Field Station to be the best of its kind in the nation. Buildings include a lodge in which to relax around a centrally located fireplace and library, and also in which all meals will be served. Sleeping quarters are in modern private rooms a short walk across campus from the lodge. Each has a single queen bed and its own bathroom and shower.
                    <br><br>Participants will have access to dual-monitor, desktop computer workstations in a recently built classroom/technology center.

                            WHO SHOULD PARTICIPATE?
                            Sharing Joy Again! will benefit most those who have successfully navigated a period of relatively intense immediate grief following a loss. However, they still might possess related  emotional needs and are looking for a path to help them transition into a more satisfying life style.
                            <br><br>Persons who regularly walk even just short distances, are in at least moderately good shape, and are at ease hiking off-trail through grassy or mostly sage-covered terrain will find no significant discomfort with the traverses.  Although the traverses may be up to a mile and a half in length, numerous stops will provide sufficient time to sit, relax, and listen to and interact with the instructors. Ample additional opportunity to explore questions with the instructors will exist during the hikes between stops.
